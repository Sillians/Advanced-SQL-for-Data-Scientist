# Advanced-SQL-for-Data-Scientist
Working with SQL using PostgreSQL, Statistics, Data Modeling, Databases.


There is an increasing need for data scientists and analysts to understand relational data stores. Organizations have long used SQL databases to store transactional data as well as business intelligence related data. If you need to work with SQL databases one needs to learn how to perform common data science tasks, including finding, exploration, and extraction within relational databases.


This Repo gives a brief overview of SQL. Then the five major things a data scientist should understand when working with relational databases: basic statistics in SQL, data preparation in SQL, advanced filtering and data aggregation, window functions, and preparing data for use with analytics tools.

The Codes in this Repo where implemented using a pgAdmin PostgreSQl

1. Data manipulation
2. ANSI standards
3. SQL and variations
4. Statistical functions in SQL
5. String, numeric, and regular expression functions in SQL
6. Advanced filtering techniques
